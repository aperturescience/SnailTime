## Id's vs strings

**NOTE:**
If you are consuming this API in an automated way (through an application), we strongly suggest relying on Id's rather than strings because the Levenshtein distance algorithm used for string searching might return unexpected results.

A list of stations and their respective Id's can be found at `/stations`.

If you prefer using strings, the API supports supplying a string as the name of a station since v0.2.0.

If no matching station can be found, an exception is returned.

```javascript
{
  error: {
    code: 404,
    message: "Could not find station: foobarbaz",
    type: "StationNotFoundException"
  }
}
```
