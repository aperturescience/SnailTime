## Available routes

|Route                |Description|

## Id's vs strings

Since v0.2.0, the API supports supplying a string as the name of a station.

If you prefer ID's, a list can be found at `/stations`.

If no matching station can be found, an exception is returned.

```
{
  error: {
    code: 404,
    message: "Could not find station: foobarbaz",
    type: "StationNotFoundException"
  }
}
```

## Localisation and i18n

The language you'd like to use is specified by supplying the **Accept-Language** header in your request as defined in [RFC 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4).

List of languages that are accepted:

- **nl, fr, de, en**

Alternatively:

- **nl-BE, fr-FR, de-DE, en-US, etc.**

Any unrecognized language will default to English.
